1. Square entered.. I get back (-1, -1) if the square is off the board or otherwise invalid input is entered
So this algorithm is assuming I have a valid entry for starting square and a valid entry for ending square but it does not check to make sure anything else including whether or not those are two different squares

1. Is starting square occupied
2. Is starting square occupied by a piece of the correct color
3. Is the ending square in a direction that the piece moves
4. Is it the correct number of moves (if relevant)
5. Are there any pieces in the way of that move?
6. Is your king in check or would moving that piece cause a king to be placed in check.



for i in range((square_on % 8)-square_on//8, 65, 8):
